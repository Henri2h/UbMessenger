## IMPORTANT

* Path rewriting etc does not work under Cordova, that's why it's important to use router 'hash' mode, if you run or build for Cordova. **history mode does not** work! The plugin already tries to fix this automatically...

* Assets and Scripts in vue's public folder need to have a dynamic path, because depending on dev or production build, you have different bases. In dev it's normally **'/'** and in production it's **'file:///android_asset/www/'**. In other words, if you have i.e. an image under **'public/images/me.jpg'**, the relative url would be **img='images/me.jpg'**

* You need some experience with Cordova, to solve many issues, like having the right Java JDK, Android SDK, XTools, Signing an App, Publishing an App etc. If you encounter issues related to Cordova etc, please don't post them this issue tracker.

* If you are upgrading from an older release, please add `<hook type="after_prepare" src="../node_modules/vue-cli-plugin-cordova/serve-config-hook.js" />` to your config.xml

* The devserver will run under https from now on, so make sure your rest & api endpoints are available under https, and have a correct CORS setup)
